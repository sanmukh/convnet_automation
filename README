This code is used to generate HLS code for 3 layered convolutional neural network in Vivado 2014 version.

SOLN is the keyword

it determines the directory in the params directory which contains a design specific inputs also, design specific outputs can be store in the same directory.

There is no streamlined way to synthesize design from C and report power as the former is done by vivado_hls and the later by vivado. 

so this requires creating two scripts
1. Generate the verilog files
2. follow the conventional verilog workflow. (overkill: synthesis will have to be done twice)


Workflow is as follows:
1. use generate_params.sh to generate the params directory structure. 
-> It generates the params.h file, tb file and constraints file and the input image
Usage: ./generate_params.sh SOLN

2. user report_power.sh to report power
-> It creates the necessary project structure and uses vivado_hls to generate the verilog files
-> uses vivado to report power and output the report in the report directory
-> copies the reports from the reports directory and stores into the params directory
Usage: ./report_power.sh SOLN
